# Cosmic-Identity-

Cosmic Identity is a quiz-based interactive experience. The answers are sorted through a series of randomized questions and then dictate what fictional planet the player would best live on. Created in P5, the code contains loops, arrays, functions, conditionals, and event listeners to handle user interactions.
